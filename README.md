# Python Keylogger using pynput

This is a simple keylogger script implemented in Python 3 using the pynput library. It logs keypresses and stores them in a text file for later analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You also need to install the pynput library. You can do this via pip:


## How to Run

To run the keylogger, follow these steps:

1. Install the pynput library if you haven't already (see Prerequisites above).
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `Keylogger.py` file.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory.
5. Run the script using the following command:


## How it Works

The keylogger listens for keyboard events using the pynput library. Each keypress is recorded and stored in a text file named `log.txt` in the same directory as the script.

To stop the keylogger, you can terminate the script manually by pressing `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or command prompt where it's running.
